I'm a 30-something father of two. I've been working remotely for more than 13 years and love it. I'm a runner by morning, a web developer by day, and a guy that loves playing with his kids and traveling all the rest of the time.

I'm a web developer with experience in front-end and back-end tech, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue, React, Email, Ruby on Rails, and WordPress. I enjoy building user-friendly interfaces that are reliable and efficient.

I have previous experience in internet marketing, SEO, and customer support, so I like to think I bring a pretty unique and valuable set of skills to the table. 

Thanks for stopping by and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannybaumann)!
